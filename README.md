# Object-Tracking-Test-
Robust Object Tracker Given a data set

From the Umich EECS442 Computer Vision course I have learned a variety of ways to process images and videos into various types of data. I used the Kalman filter technique to identify the object of interest and draw a rectangle around the object in every image. 
Given a set of trainable images, the semi-robust object-tracking script takes in frames. take the frames and draw a box around the identified object.

This works on 2D images and videos the best, with 100% accuracy. when asked to track the head of a moving woman its accuracy falls 
I hope to incorporate this into a 2D video game AI bot
